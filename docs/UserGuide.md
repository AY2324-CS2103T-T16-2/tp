## Command Overview

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
**:warning: Using the PDF version of this guide?**

If you're _copying and pasting_ commands that **span multiple lines** from the PDF, be aware that space characters surrounding line breaks may be omitted when pasted into the application. Keep an eye out for any missing spaces to ensure your commands work smoothly!
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used with or without a tag, like `n/John Doe t/friend` or simply `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be completely omitted, inlcuded once as `t/friend`, or multiple times like `t/friend t/family`.<br>
  e.g. `INDICES…` represent a parameter that has to be used at least once because of the absence of square brackets.

* Items that start with `--` are flags that alter the command's default behavior.<br>
  Any redundant text after the flag will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `--all`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Redundant text/parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Need a hand? Just type `help` to access the help page and get the guidance you need!

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### Adding a person: `add`

Ready to expand your address book? Let's add someone new!

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [b/BIRTHDAY] [$/MONEY_OWED] [t/TAG]… [d/DAY]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Names in FriendFolio**

* Names are unique in FriendFolio, therefore people with the same name must be differentiated either with extra
  characters or otherwise. For example, if "John Tan" exists in your contacts:
    * E.g: `add n/John Tan p/98765432 e/johnT@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` fails.
    * E.g: `add n/John Tan from SoC p/98765432 e/johnT@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` succeeds.
* Note that duplicate name detection is **case-sensitive**, therefore:
    * E.g: `add n/john tan p/98765432 e/johnT@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` also succeeds.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"><a id="attribute-constraints"></a>
**:information_source: Attribute constraints:**

* Names are **alphanumeric** and can contain spaces.
* Phone numbers have to be numeric and at least 3 digits long.
* Addresses have to start with a non-whitespace character.
* Birthdays follow the following format: `dd/mm/yyyy`.
* Money owed ranges from -100,000 to 100,000 and has to be a numeric input with at most 2 decimal places. This means that maximum total amount you can owe or a person owes you is $100,000.
* Emails are a little tricky, but in short, a valid email is in the format `local-part@domain`, where:
    * The local-part contains only alphanumeric characters and any number of these special characters: `+_.-`, but may not start or end with them.
    * The domain consists of one or more labels separated by `.`, e.g. `gmail.com`.
    * Don't worry, as long as the email you enter follows the conventional email format, you're good to go!
* Tags have to be alphanumeric.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags or days available (including 0)
</div>

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/15/02/1999`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`
* `add n/Plain Jane t/friend e/plainjane@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/2345678 b/01/01/2001 d/monday $/100`

### Listing all persons: `list`

Want to see everyone who is in your address book? Just type `list` to get a full rundown!

Format: `list`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
**:bulb: Tip:** You can use the `list` command after a [`filter`](#filtering-based-on-selected-types-filter) command to get back the original list of contacts.
</div>

### Editing a person: `edit`

Time for some updates! Let's tweak an existing entry in your address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]… [b/BIRTHDAY] [$/MONEY_OWED] [d/DAY]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the contact list on the left.<br>
  Make sure it's a **positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …)
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be overwritten by the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:question: Need a refresher on the constraints for some of these fields? Refer to the attribute constraints [here](#attribute-constraints)!
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** You can use the `filter` command and then the `edit` command. The index you provide will be based on the filter result. This applies to any command that takes in an index.
</div>

Examples:

* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567`
  and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
* `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Deleting a person: `delete`

Time to trim the roster! Let's remove someone from your address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the contact list on the left.
* Make sure it's a **positive integer** (e.g. 1, 2, 3, …)

Examples:

* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `filter name Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Filtering based on selected types: `filter`

Let's narrow down your search! Use the filter command to refine your contact list based on specific criteria.
You can choose to filter by day available, by name or by tags, and specify if the returned contacts should match any
or all of the keywords specified using the `--all` optional flag at the end of the command.

Format:

1. `filter tag TAG_NAME… [--all]` OR
2. `filter name PERSON_NAME… [--all]` OR
3. `filter day DAY… [--all]`

* **At least one** of the types (`tag`, `name`, or `day`) needs to be used.
* If multiple `TAG_NAME`, `PERSON_NAME` or `DAY` is used, the default result
  returned will be all matching contacts to any of the keywords.
* Adding the --all flag ensures only contacts matching all the keywords are shown. Any text after the flag will be ignored!

Examples:

* `filter tag friend` returns contacts that has the tag "friend" attached to them.
* `filter day wednesday friday` returns contacts available on Wednesday, Friday, or both.
* `filter day monday tuesday --all` returns all contacts available on **both** Monday and Tuesday.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Use the `list` command after a `filter` command to reset any filters and display all contacts! This will not affect the current order of contacts, if you have used the [`sort`](#sorting-contacts-sort) command.
</div>

### Lending an amount: `lend`

Ready to lend a hand (or some cash)? Use the lend command to manage money transactions with your contacts.

Format: `lend INDEX $/MONEY_OWED`

* Use **positive** `MONEY_OWED` to lend money to the person, and **negative** `MONEY_OWED` to borrow from them.
* `MONEY_OWED` ranges from -100,000 to 100,000.
* The index refers to the number shown in the contact list. Ensure it's a **positive integer** (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

Examples:

* If the **first two** people in the contact list owe you $3 now,
    * `lend 1 $/2` &#8594; first person owes you $5 now
    * `lend 2 $/-1.50` &#8594; second person owes you $0.50 now

### Splitting an amount owed: `split`

Time to divide and conquer! Use the split command to evenly distribute a sum of money owed among yourself and a group of people.

Format: `split INDICES… $/MONEY_OWED`

* MONEY_OWED be a positive number at most 100,000 and have **at most 2 decimal places**.
* The amount will be evenly distributed among you and the group of people with index mentioned and the split amount will be added on to their current amount of money owed.
* The amount the person owes you after splitting cannot exceed 100,000.
* The amount after splitting should be at least 0.01.
* There must be **at least 1** index.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the contact list.

Examples:

* `split 1 2 $/6.60` evenly divides $6.60 among you and two other people, adding $2.20 to the amount owed by the first and second people in your contact list.

### Sorting contacts: `sort`

Time to tidy things up! Use the sort command to organize your contacts in a way that suits you best.

Format: `sort SORT_METHOD`

`SORT_METHOD` should be one of the following keywords:

1. `name`: Sorts contacts alphabetically by name.
2. `birthday`: Arranges contacts based on upcoming birthdays, with those closest to today appearing first.
3. `money`: Prioritizes contacts based on the amount owed, with those owed the most money appearing first, followed by those who owe you the most.
4. `clear`: Resets the sorting method to the default, listing contacts in the order they were added to FriendFolio.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Feel free to use the [`filter`](#filtering-based-on-selected-types-filter) command together with this command to filter our your contacts and show them in whichever order you please!
</div>

### Generating payment QR code: `pay`

Ready to make payments a breeze? Use the pay command to generate a QR code for quick transactions.

Format: `pay INDEX`

* The person at that index should have a valid **Singaporean number** that is **registered with PayNow**.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the contact list.

Examples:

* `pay 3` will generate a PayNow QR code for the third person in the contact list.

#### QR Code Window

![PayNow Window](images/PayNowWindow.png)

* After the QR code is displayed, you can scan it with your local banking application to pay the user. If you owe them money, that amount will be set as the default payment, but you can adjust the amount within your banking application.
* If you owe the person money, you can click on the **Clear Debt** button to reset your money owed to $0 and close this window.
* Otherwise, click on the **Close Window** button to exit.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: **Potential errors:**

* Invalid index.
* The person at the index does not have a valid Singaporean number.
* The person's number is not registered to PayNow.

</div>

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Ready to start fresh? Use the `clear` command to wipe out all entries from your address book.

Format: `clear`

### Adding or Editing a Remark: `remark`

Let's add a personal touch! Use the `remark` command to add or edit remarks for your contacts.

Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Parameters:

- `INDEX`: The index number shown in the contact list. Must be a positive integer.
- `r/[REMARK]`: The remark to add or edit for the person. Leave this blank to remove any existing remarks.

Example:

- `remark 1 r/Likes to swim.` This command replaces the remark of the first person in the contact list with "Likes to swim".

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Ready to sign off? Just use the `exit` command to close the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Your FriendFolio data is automatically saved to the hard disk after any command that alters the data. No manual saving required!

### Editing the data file

FriendFolio automatically saves your data as a JSON file located at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users can directly edit this data file if needed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, FriendFolio will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the FriendFolio to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous FriendFolio home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Coming Soon in v2.0

***Making Phone Number and Email Address Unique***

Affects `add`, `edit`

FriendFolio is looking to make the person's phone number and email the unique identifiers in the future.
This change aims to prevent multiple individuals from sharing the same email or phone number within the system
while allowing multiple individuals with the same name to exist.

***Improved responsiveness of GUI***

We are aware that excessively long text, like long names, addresses, and remarks etc. might not display fully in a smaller window. While you are able to make the window larger to display more text, we seek your patience while we work on improving the responsiveness of our user interface to handle longer inputs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
